About the Book  
**Skyy’s Colorful Kind Heart** is a heartfelt children’s story created under the **Butterfly Perfect®** brand.  
The book encourages children to show kindness, celebrate differences, include others, and treat everyone with love — no matter their race, background, or ability.

Skyy, an imaginative little girl with a heart full of empathy, discovers that kindness is a superpower that makes the world brighter. Through simple moments of helping, caring, and understanding, she shows young readers how powerful a kind heart can be.
